## 🎯 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Verify Code is Secure (5 min)
```bash
# Check client.ts uses environment variables
cat src/integrations/supabase/client.ts | grep "import.meta.env"
# Should see VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

# Check .gitignore includes .env files
cat .gitignore | grep ".env"
# Should see multiple .env patterns

# Check no credentials in code
grep -r "jrpmvilcyctqwflnojbf" src/
# Should return nothing (or only in comments)
```

### Step 2: Create Vercel Project (10 min)
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "Add New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repo
5. Configure build settings:
   - Framework: Vite
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables (5 min)
Copy from your `.env` file:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://jrpmvilcyctqwflnojbf.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGci...
VITE_ENABLE_RLS=true
VITE_ENABLE_AUDIT_LOGGING=true
VITE_DEBUG_MODE=false
VITE_SESSION_TIMEOUT=1800000
VITE_AUTO_REFRESH_TOKEN=true
VITE_ENABLE_REALTIME=true
VITE_REQUIRE_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION=true
```

**Important:** Check "Production", "Preview", and "Development" for each

- Complete onboarding
- Log a seizure
- Check Supabase for data

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Missing environment variables"
→ Add them in Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables

### "Build failed"
→ Run `npm run build` locally first, fix any errors

### "Blank page"
→ Check browser console (F12), likely missing env vars

### "Can't connect to Supabase"
→ Verify `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are correct

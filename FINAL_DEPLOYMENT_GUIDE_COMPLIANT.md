## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### STEP 1: Reset Database (5 minutes)

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```
   https://app.supabase.com/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/sql/new
   ```

2. **Drop existing public schema:**
   ```sql
   DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;
   CREATE SCHEMA public;
   GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO postgres;
   GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO public;
   ```

3. Click **RUN** and wait for completion

---

### STEP 2: Deploy Base Schema (2-3 minutes)

1. Copy **entire contents** of `COMPLETE_RESEARCH_GRADE_SCHEMA.sql`
2. Paste into SQL Editor
3. Click **RUN**
4. Wait for success message

**Expected:** ~1000 lines executed, 25+ tables created

---

### STEP 3: Apply Compliance Fixes (2 minutes)

1. In same SQL Editor or new tab
2. Copy **entire contents** of `COMPLIANCE_FIXES_CRITICAL.sql`
3. Paste into SQL Editor
4. Click **RUN**
5. Wait for success message

**This adds:**
- ✅ IP address hashing for audit logs
- ✅ Protected research user mapping
- ✅ Carer/clinician access expiry
- ✅ Breach detection system
- ✅ Security incidents tracking

---

### STEP 3.5: Apply Immediate Fixes (2 minutes)

**You encountered errors because the compliance script references enum values that don't exist yet.**

1. Copy **entire contents** of `DEPLOYMENT_FIXES_IMMEDIATE.sql`
2. Paste into SQL Editor
3. Click **RUN**
4. Wait for success message

**This fixes:**
- ✅ Adds missing enum values (expired, verification_required)
- ✅ IP salt workaround (stored in protected table instead of database parameter)
- ✅ Updates hash_ip function to use table-based salt

---

### STEP 4: Configure Security Settings (5 minutes)

#### A. Verify IP Hashing Salt

**✅ Already configured!** The DEPLOYMENT_FIXES_IMMEDIATE.sql script stored your salt in the protected.system_settings table.

To verify:
```sql
SELECT value FROM protected.system_settings WHERE key = 'ip_salt';
-- Should return: X12YZ/4I9pdDdnCr1cO6T9V3VyQfcngpjvrNS7kexo0=
```

**Note:** Supabase doesn't allow custom database parameters without superuser privileges. The salt is now stored securely in a protected table that only the hash_ip() function can access.

#### B. Configure Backups & Encryption

**✅ Encryption is AUTOMATIC on all Supabase tiers** (Pro, Teams, Enterprise). There's no setting to configure - it's always on.

**Backups - IMPORTANT INFORMATION:**

1. **For Development/Testing:**
   - ✅ 7-day PITR is FINE ($0-10/month extra)
   - You're not handling real patient data yet
   - Shorter retention = significant cost savings

2. **For Production with Real Patient Data:**
   - You MUST upgrade to **Teams tier** ($599/month minimum)
   - Why? **Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is REQUIRED for HIPAA**
   - Without a BAA, you cannot legally store patient data, regardless of technical security
   - Pro tier does NOT include BAA or HIPAA compliance guarantees

3. **PITR Backup Retention:**
   - 7 days: Acceptable for dev/test
   - 30 days: Recommended for production but not legally required
   - HIPAA only requires backups exist and are encrypted (they are)

**Current Setup (Pro Tier with 7-day PITR):**
- ✅ Good for development and testing with fake data
- ❌ NOT compliant for real patient data (no BAA)
- ✅ All technical security measures are in place
- ⏳ Upgrade to Teams before going live with real patients

**In Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to **Settings** > **Database** > **Backups**
2. Your 7-day PITR is already configured ✅
3. Encryption is automatic (you won't see a checkbox - it's always on) ✅ 

#### C. Enforce SSL Connections

In Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Database**
2. Under "Connection string" section
3. Note that SSL is required by default
4. In your app's connection string, ensure `sslmode=require`

#### D. Configure Auth Settings

In Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to **Authentication** > **Settings**
2. Set **Session timeout**: 30 minutes
3. Enable **Email confirmation**
4. Enable **Password requirements**: 
   - Minimum 12 characters
   - Require uppercase
   - Require numbers
   - Require symbols
5. Set **Maximum failed login attempts**: 5
6. Set **Lockout duration**: 30 minutes

---

### STEP 5: Verify Deployment (5 minutes)

Run these verification queries in SQL Editor:

```sql
-- 1. Check table count (should be 25+)
SELECT COUNT(*) as table_count 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- 2. Check enum count (should be 25+)
SELECT COUNT(*) as enum_count 
FROM pg_type 
WHERE typnamespace = 'public'::regnamespace 
AND typtype = 'e';

-- 3. Verify audit log has IP hashing
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'audit_log' 
AND column_name LIKE '%ip%';
-- Should show: ip_address_hash | text

-- 4. Verify protected schema exists
SELECT nspname 
FROM pg_namespace 
WHERE nspname = 'protected';
-- Should return: protected

-- 5. Verify research mapping is protected
SELECT schemaname, tablename 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'research_user_mapping';
-- Should show: protected | research_user_mapping

-- 6. Check carer access has expiry
SELECT column_name 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'carer_relationships' 
AND column_name LIKE '%expir%';
-- Should show: access_expires_at

-- 7. Verify security incidents table exists
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name = 'security_incidents';
-- Should return: 1

-- 8. Check RLS is enabled on all user tables
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename NOT IN ('conditions', 'medications')
ORDER BY tablename;
-- All should show rowsecurity = true

-- 9. Verify seed data
SELECT name, tracking_features_array 
FROM public.conditions;
-- Should return 4 conditions

-- 10. Check audit triggers exist
SELECT DISTINCT trigger_name 
FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name LIKE 'audit_%'
ORDER BY trigger_name;
-- Should show 7+ audit triggers
```

**Expected Results:**
- All queries return expected values
- No errors in output
- Schema is fully deployed

---

### STEP 6: Test Frontend Integration (10 minutes)

#### A. Test User Registration

1. Sign up as new patient
2. Complete onboarding flow
3. Add condition (e.g., Epilepsy)
4. Add medication
5. Set research consent

**Verify in database:**
```sql
-- Check your user was created correctly
SELECT 
    pp.first_name, 
    p.user_type, 
    p.onboarding_completed,
    COUNT(uc.id) as conditions_count,
    COUNT(um.id) as medications_count
FROM patient_profiles pp
JOIN profiles p ON p.id = pp.user_id
LEFT JOIN user_conditions uc ON uc.user_id = pp.user_id
LEFT JOIN user_medications um ON um.user_id = pp.user_id
WHERE pp.user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
GROUP BY pp.first_name, p.user_type, p.onboarding_completed;
```

#### B. Test Tracking Features

1. **Log a Seizure:**
   - Open seizure modal
   - Complete all 5 steps
   - Save

2. **Log Daily Wellness:**
   - Set mood/energy/sleep
   - Add exercise info
   - Save

3. **Log Medication:**
   - Select medication
   - Set adherence
   - Save

**Verify in database:**
```sql
-- Check seizure was logged with correct enums
SELECT 
    seizure_type,
    consciousness_level,
    duration_seconds,
    identified_triggers,
    aura_present,
    witnessed
FROM seizure_logs
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Check daily wellness uses enums
SELECT 
    log_date,
    mood,
    energy_level,
    sleep_quality,
    sleep_hours
FROM daily_wellness_logs
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
ORDER BY log_date DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Check medication log
SELECT 
    adherence_status,
    side_effects_present,
    log_date
FROM medication_logs
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

#### C. Verify Audit Logging

```sql
-- Check audit trail exists
SELECT 
    action,
    table_name,
    ip_address_hash,
    created_at
FROM audit_log
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected:** All actions logged with hashed IPs

---

### STEP 7: Configure Monitoring (15 minutes)

#### A. Set Up Security Incident Alerts

Create a scheduled function to check for unresolved incidents:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION notify_unresolved_incidents()
RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
    incident_count INT;
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO incident_count
    FROM security_incidents
    WHERE resolved_at IS NULL
    AND severity IN ('high', 'critical')
    AND detected_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
    
    IF incident_count > 0 THEN
        -- In production, integrate with your alerting system
        RAISE NOTICE 'ALERT: % unresolved security incidents', incident_count;
    END IF;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### B. Enable pg_cron (Optional)

If you have Supabase Pro plan with pg_cron enabled:

```sql
-- Enable extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;

-- Schedule audit cleanup (monthly)
SELECT cron.schedule(
    'cleanup-old-audit-logs',
    '0 0 1 * *',
    'SELECT public.cleanup_old_audit_logs_safe()'
);

-- Schedule security check (hourly)
SELECT cron.schedule(
    'check-security-incidents',
    '0 * * * *',
    'SELECT notify_unresolved_incidents()'
);
```

#### C. Configure External Monitoring

Integrate with your monitoring service:
- Set up alerts for failed queries
- Monitor database connections
- Track response times
- Alert on high CPU/memory usage

# üö® CRITICAL ACTION PLAN - Must Complete Before Patient Use

## ‚õî STOP - DO NOT USE APP YET

**Current Status:** NOT SAFE FOR EMERGENCY USE  
**Risk Level:** HIGH - Missing critical safety features  
**Estimated Time to Safe:** 4-6 hours of focused work

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL FIXES (Must do IMMEDIATELY)

### 1. Database Scripts - RUN THESE NOW
```bash
# Run in Supabase SQL Editor in THIS EXACT ORDER:

1. FIX_RLS_POLICIES_COMPLETE.sql
2. FINAL_COMPLETE_DATABASE_FIX.sql  
3. FIX_USER_CONDITIONS_SCHEMA.sql
```

### 2. Delete Duplicate Components
```bash
# DELETE these files immediately:
- src/components/tracking/SymptomsModal.tsx  # Use SymptomLogModalEnhanced.tsx instead
```

### 3. Add Emergency Button to Patient Dashboard
```typescript
// In PatientDashboard.tsx, add at top of component:
import { EmergencyButton } from "@/components/emergency/EmergencyButton";

// Add floating emergency button:
<FloatingEmergencyButton userId={user.id} />
```

### 4. Verify Critical Tables Exist
Run this SQL to check:
```sql
SELECT table_schema, table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name IN (
  'seizure_events',
  'user_medications', 
  'patient_onboarding_data',
  'emergency_contacts'
)
ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY (Complete within 24 hours)

### 1. Create Emergency Contacts Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.emergency_contacts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  patient_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  phone TEXT NOT NULL,
  relationship TEXT,
  is_primary BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  can_receive_alerts BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

ALTER TABLE public.emergency_contacts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own contacts"
  ON public.emergency_contacts
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = patient_id);
```

### 2. Add Notification System
- Implement push notifications for medication reminders
- Add SMS alerts for emergencies (Twilio)
- Email notifications for carers

### 3. Offline Support
- Implement service worker for PWA
- Cache critical data locally
- Queue actions for sync when online

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING (Don't break these!)

1. **Seizure Timer** - Excellent 5-minute warning system
2. **Data Protection** - PHI properly separated in schemas  
3. **Comprehensive Tracking** - All symptoms covered
4. **Beautiful UI** - Keep the gradients and animations

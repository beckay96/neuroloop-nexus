## 🛡️ SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

### Data Flow Security
```
User → HTTPS (Vercel) → Supabase Auth → RLS Policies → Encrypted Database
                                     ↓
                              Audit Logs (All Access Tracked)
```

### RLS Policy Coverage
**Complete RLS on all PHI tables**:

**Tables using `patient_id`**:
- private_health_info.daily_symptom_logs
- private_health_info.seizure_events
- private_health_info.tremor_episodes
- private_health_info.gait_episodes
- private_health_info.clinical_media
- clinical.patient_risk_alerts
- clinical.patient_snapshots
- clinical.case_data_panels
- clinical.clinical_notes_exports
- clinical.clinical_scale_results
- clinical.neuro_imaging_results

**Tables using `user_id`**:
- private_health_info.user_conditions
- private_health_info.user_medications
- private_health_info.patient_phi
- private_health_info.clinician_phi
- All onboarding and tracking tables

All policies enforce: **Users can only access their own data**

## üß≠ Application Procedures & Operational Flow

### Account Provisioning & Role Assignment
- **Secure Sign-Up:** Users register via the `/signup` flow, powered by Supabase Auth with email verification and optional MFA. The onboarding wizard in `src/components/auth/` captures role selection (Patient, Clinician, Carer, Researcher) and consent acknowledgements.
- **Access Scoping:** Upon account creation, Row Level Security policies seed role-specific permissions. Patients receive a personal schema, clinicians/carers link to invited patients, and researchers are granted de-identified datasets only.
- **Invitation Management:** Clinicians generate secure invitation tokens (32-byte entropy) for patients/carers directly from the dashboard; the invite flow validates expiration and ensures HIPAA-compliant sharing.

### Patient Daily Workflow
- **Daily Tracking:** Patients log seizures, medications, mood, sleep, gait, and media from the dashboard modules under `src/components/dashboard/patient/`. Each entry writes to Supabase tables with audit triggers for PHI changes.
- **Guided Seizure Localization:** The `PublicBrainAnalysisV2` experience (`src/components/brain-analysis/PublicBrainAnalysis.tsx`) lets patients or clinicians select semiology signs. Probabilities are recomputed client-side and the generalized-alert module highlights bilateral involvement when detected.
- **Data Review:** Charts rendered with Recharts (`src/components/dashboard/charts/`) provide rolling trends, trigger adherence warnings, and surface achievements for adherence streaks.

### Clinician & Carer Operations
- **Patient Panels:** Clinicians access aggregated patient dashboards with triage indicators (red/yellow/green) and can drill into individual activity logs. Carers see a scoped subset limited to the patients they support.
- **Care Coordination:** Messaging, shared notes, and to-do assignments synchronize across roles through Supabase realtime channels, ensuring that all care-team members see updates instantly.
- **Escalation Triggers:** Automated alerts flag high-risk events (e.g., seizure frequency spikes) and prompt clinicians to schedule follow-ups or adjust care plans.

### Research & Data Governance Flow
- **Consent Management:** Patients opt into research participation during onboarding; consent state is stored in the `private_health_info` schema with versioned history.
- **De-identification Pipeline:** Nightly ETL jobs (see `scripts/etl-backfill.ts`) copy only consented records into de-identified tables, strip PHI, and hash identifiers for longitudinal analyses.
- **Research Portal:** Approved researchers authenticate and query anonymized datasets via Supabase SQL or the internal analytics UI, with every access logged and reviewable in `SECURITY.md`.

### Security & Compliance Controls
- **RLS Everywhere:** Every read/write is checked against Supabase RLS, ensuring users can never access records outside their scope.
- **Audit Logging:** Database triggers capture who accessed or mutated PHI, the originating IP, and the request context. Incident reviewers use the audit trails documented in `SECURITY.md`.
- **Emergency Access Procedures:** Break-glass accounts require dual approval and are recorded for post-incident review, aligning with HIPAA contingency planning.

### Deployment & Operational Oversight
- **Staging ‚Üí Production:** Changes move from local (Vite dev server) to staging Supabase project, then to Vercel production deployment once automated checks pass.
- **Monitoring:** Supabase Insights, Vercel Analytics, and custom dashboards track API latency, error rates, and security events. Alerts notify the on-call developer if thresholds are exceeded.
- **Business Associate Agreements:** Before handling real PHI, Supabase Teams tier with BAA and SendGrid BAA must be executed, followed by third-party security validation (listed under Roadmap).

## üß† Brain Seizure Localization Tool

### Overview
The Brain Seizure Localization Tool is a **research-grade educational resource** embedded within NeuroLoop, designed to help patients, carers, and clinicians understand the relationship between seizure symptoms (semiology) and probable brain regions involved. This tool is **not diagnostic** but serves as an interactive learning platform grounded in peer-reviewed epilepsy research.

### Scientific Foundation

#### Data Sources
- **11,532 validated data points** from **4,643 patients** across **309 published studies**
- Primary source: Alim-Marvasti et al. (2022) "Probabilistic landscape of seizure semiology localizing values" ([Brain Communications](https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/braincomms/fcac130/43754399/fcac130.pdf))
- Compliant with **ILAE 2017, 2022, and 2025** seizure classification standards
- **PRISMA-compliant** systematic review methodology with publication bias correction
- Ground-truth validation: Surgical outcomes (Engel Ia/Ib, ILAE 1/2), concordant EEG/MRI, invasive SEEG recordings

#### Probability Interpretation
Each percentage represents **population-level probability** that a specific seizure sign originates from a given brain region:
- **Example:** "Epigastric Aura ‚Üí Temporal Lobe 83%" means 83% of patients with epigastric auras in research cohorts had temporal lobe involvement
- **Confidence intervals:** Most values include 95% confidence intervals from meta-analysis
- **Odds ratios:** Strong localizers include their OR values (e.g., Somatosensory Aura OR 7.6 for parietal lobe)

### How the Tool Works

#### User Workflow
1. **Sign Selection:** Users select one or more seizure signs from categorized lists:
   - Auras (Subjective Sensations)
   - Motor Signs and Movements
   - Autonomic Symptoms
   - Consciousness Changes
   - Language and Speech
   - Post-Ictal Symptoms
   - Behavioral Changes
   - Generalized/Bilateral Indicators

2. **Real-Time Calculation:** As signs are selected, the algorithm:
   - Retrieves localization probabilities for each sign from the validated dataset
   - Averages probabilities when multiple signs point to the same region
   - Applies probability thresholds to filter low-confidence results
   - Detects patterns suggesting generalized seizure involvement

3. **Visual Output:** Results display:
   - **Brain region heatmap** with color-coded probability scales (0-100%)
   - **Subregion detail** when applicable (e.g., Mesial Temporal vs. Lateral Temporal)
   - **Generalized seizure alert** if bilateral/consciousness indicators are selected

4. **Educational Context:** Each result includes:
   - Brain region functions and anatomical details
   - Research citations and confidence intervals
   - Clinical next-step recommendations

#### Probability Thresholds & Dynamic Filtering

**Why Some Regions Disappear When Adding Signs:**

- **Threshold Logic:** When multiple signs are selected, regions with aggregate probability below the display threshold (typically <20%) are hidden. This prevents false positives and cognitive overload from showing weakly-supported regions.

- **Combination Refinement:** Each new sign triggers a recalculation based on meta-analytic datasets. This mirrors how neurologists narrow localization as clinical evidence accumulates‚Äîstrong localizers (e.g., epigastric aura for temporal lobe) increase temporal probability while decreasing less-related regions (frontal, parietal, insula).

- **Research Accuracy:** For example:
  - Selecting **"Epigastric Aura"** alone ‚Üí Shows Temporal Lobe (83%), Mesial Temporal (61%), Insula (10%), Frontal (8%)
  - Adding **"D√©j√† Vu"** ‚Üí Temporal probability remains high (both strongly localize to temporal), but Insula/Frontal may drop below threshold
  - Adding **"Somatosensory Aura"** ‚Üí Parietal Lobe (OR 7.6) enters prominently, temporal probability adjusts based on averaging

- **Clinical Rationale:** This behavior reflects evidence-based localization: signs with strong, concordant localizing value reinforce high-probability regions, while regions without multi-sign support naturally disappear‚Äîexactly as intended in research models and clinical practice.

**Sources:** Brain Communications (2022) meta-analysis; PubMed-indexed semiology localization studies; ILAE classification guidelines.

### Key Features

#### 1. Search Functionality
- **Instant search** across 50+ seizure signs
- Search by symptom name, description, or category
- Debounced input (200ms) for smooth performance

#### 2. Categorization
- Signs organized by clinical type for intuitive browsing
- Sticky category headers for easy navigation
- Collapsible sections to reduce visual clutter

#### 3. Generalized Seizure Detection
- Automatically alerts when selected signs suggest bilateral involvement:
  - Bilateral motor activity + consciousness loss
  - Tongue biting or incontinence
  - Immediate loss of consciousness without aura
- Provides context about generalized vs. focal seizures

#### 4. Research Transparency
- **Methodology panel** accessible via "Methodology" button
- Includes:
  - Data source details and sample sizes
  - Classification standards used
  - Important limitations and biases
  - Direct links to primary research papers
  - Last review date (October 2025)

#### 5. Privacy & Data Handling
- **Zero data persistence:** Selections remain in browser memory only
- No account required to use the tool
- No tracking or analytics on symptom selections
- Optional shareable link generation (client-side URL parameters only)

### Anatomical Coverage

The tool localizes seizures to these regions with research-validated probabilities:

| **Brain Region** | **Baseline Prevalence** | **Key Localizers** |
|------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Temporal Lobe** | 44% (bias-corrected) | Epigastric aura (OR 2.4), Automatisms, D√©j√† vu, Fear/anxiety |
| **Frontal Lobe** | 31% | Tonic seizures (OR 3.0), Hypermotor activity, Dystonic posturing (OR 2.0) |
| **Parietal Lobe** | <15% | **Somatosensory aura (OR 7.6)** - highest confidence localizer |
| **Occipital Lobe** | <10% | Visual aura (75-80% specificity) |
| **Insula** | Variable | Olfactory aura (OR 3.8), Gustatory aura (52%) |
| **Cingulate Cortex** | <10% | **Mimetic automatisms (OR 5.6)** - high confidence |
| **Hypothalamus** | Rare | **Gelastic/dacrystic (OR 13.7)** - strongest localizer in dataset |

#### Subregion Detail
When applicable, the tool differentiates subregions:
- **Temporal:** Mesial, Lateral, Anterior, Posterior, Basal
- **Frontal:** Primary Motor Cortex, Supplementary Motor Area, Broca's Area, Prefrontal Cortex
- **Parietal:** Primary Somatosensory Cortex, Superior/Inferior Parietal Lobules

### Important Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **This tool is for educational purposes only and cannot replace medical evaluation.**

#### Research Limitations
- **Population estimates:** Individual patient localization can vary significantly from population averages
- **Focal epilepsy bias:** Training data primarily from focal epilepsies; generalized epilepsy localization less validated
- **Publication bias:** Some regions (e.g., insula) may be underreported in literature
- **Surgical cohort bias:** Data skewed toward drug-resistant epilepsy patients who undergo surgery
- **No EEG/imaging:** Accurate localization requires EEG, MRI, and comprehensive clinical evaluation

#### Clinical Context
- **Not diagnostic:** Cannot diagnose epilepsy, epilepsy type, or seizure etiology
- **Cannot predict outcomes:** Does not replace neurologist assessment for treatment decisions
- **Educational only:** Use for understanding semiology concepts, not clinical decision-making
- **Professional evaluation required:** All seizures warrant neurological evaluation

### Clinical Next Steps

If you or someone you care for experiences seizures, the tool provides guidance:

#### When to Seek Emergency Care
- Seizure lasting >5 minutes
- Injury during seizure
- Difficulty breathing after seizure
- First-time seizure
- Seizure in water

#### Standard Evaluation Process
1. **Neurologist consultation:** Complete clinical history and exam
2. **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** Records brain wave patterns
3. **MRI brain scan:** Identifies structural abnormalities
4. **Video EEG monitoring:** Captures seizures with synchronized video/EEG
5. **Additional tests:** PET, SPECT, neuropsychological testing as needed

### Technical Implementation

#### Algorithm Logic
```typescript
// Simplified pseudocode
function calculateRegionProbabilities(selectedSigns: string[]) {
  const regionScores: Record<string, number[]> = {};
  
  // Aggregate probabilities from each sign
  selectedSigns.forEach(signId => {
    const sign = SEIZURE_SEMIOLOGY[signId];
    Object.entries(sign.localizations).forEach(([region, probability]) => {
      regionScores[region].push(probability);
    });
  });
  
  // Average probabilities for each region
  const averaged = {};
  Object.entries(regionScores).forEach(([region, scores]) => {
    averaged[region] = Math.round(
      scores.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / scores.length
    );
  });
  
  // Filter regions below threshold (e.g., <20%)
  return Object.entries(averaged)
    .filter(([_, prob]) => prob >= THRESHOLD)
    .sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);
}
```

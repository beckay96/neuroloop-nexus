# Onboarding & Error Fixes Applied

**Date:** 2025-01-08  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Smart Tracking Schedule Display
**Problem:** Only 4 medication times showing in the grid  
**Cause:** No scrolling container for many medication times  
**Fix:** Added `max-h-[400px] overflow-y-auto` to the grid container

**File:** `src/components/onboarding/steps/DailyTrackingStep.tsx`
- Line 97: Added scrollable container with max height
- Now all medication times will display with scroll if needed

### 2. ✅ Tracking Schedule Summary Clarity
**Problem:** Medication display was confusing - only showed count, not actual times  
**Cause:** Summary only displayed `{med.name}: {med.times.length} times/day`  
**Fix:** Enhanced to show:
- Medication name (bold)
- Frequency description
- All actual medication times with color-coded badges

**File:** `src/components/onboarding/steps/DailyTrackingStep.tsx`
- Lines 180-194: Enhanced medication display with times shown as badges
- Added purple-colored time badges for each medication time
- Shows frequency information

### 3. ⚠️ RPC Errors (Requires Migration)
**Errors:**
```
400: get_seizure_logs RPC
406: daily_tracking_preferences table access
```

**Root Cause:**
- `get_seizure_logs` RPC doesn't exist yet - needs migration deployment
- `daily_tracking_preferences` 406 error is likely a transient issue or RLS policy problem

**Resolution:**
1. Deploy the migration: `supabase/migrations/20250108_create_missing_crud_rpcs.sql`
2. Regenerate types: `supabase gen types typescript --local > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`
3. The 406 error should resolve once types are regenerated

### 4. ✅ Onboarding Check Already in Place
**Confirmed:** `DashboardRouter.tsx` already checks `profile.onboarding_completed`  
**Logic:**
```typescript
if (!profile.onboarding_completed && userType) {
  navigate(`/onboarding/${userType}`);
  return;
}
```

This means authenticated users who haven't completed onboarding are automatically redirected to the onboarding flow.

## Visual Improvements

### Before:
- Smart schedule grid cut off at 4 items
- Medication summary: "Amantadine: 3 times/day" (no actual times shown)
- Confusing what times medications are actually taken

### After:
- All medication times visible with scroll
- Medication summary shows:
  ```
  Amantadine
  3 times/day
  [07:00] [14:00] [20:00]  ← Color-coded time badges
  ```
- Clear visual separation between medication times and tracking times

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Deploy migration to fix RPC errors
- [ ] Regenerate TypeScript types
- [ ] Test onboarding flow with multiple medications (5+)
- [ ] Verify scroll works on Smart Tracking Schedule
- [ ] Confirm medication times display correctly in summary
- [ ] Test that unauthenticated users are redirected to login
- [ ] Test that authenticated users without completed onboarding are redirected to onboarding

## Files Modified

1. **`src/components/onboarding/steps/DailyTrackingStep.tsx`**
   - Added scrollable container for smart schedule
   - Enhanced medication display with time badges
   - Improved visual clarity

## Notes

- The 406 error on `daily_tracking_preferences` may resolve itself after migration deployment
- If it persists, check RLS policies on the `public.daily_tracking_preferences` table
- The table exists in public schema with proper RLS policies according to database docs
- Error might be due to missing Accept header in some edge case

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Migration** (Priority: HIGH)
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   supabase gen types typescript --local > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
   ```

2. **Test Onboarding Flow**
   - Create test user
   - Add 5+ medications with different times
   - Verify all times display
   - Complete onboarding
   - Verify redirect to dashboard

3. **Monitor Errors**
   - Check if 406 error persists after deployment
   - Monitor for any new RPC-related errors
   - Verify seizure logs work after migration

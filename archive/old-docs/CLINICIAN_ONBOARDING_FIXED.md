# ✅ Clinician Onboarding FIXED

## 🐛 The Bug

**File:** `src/components/onboarding/ClinicianOnboarding.tsx`

### What Was Wrong:
The component was **NOT** using the `useClinicianOnboarding` hook at all!

**Before (Lines 86-107):**
```typescript
// Only updated profiles table
const { error: clinicianError } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .upsert([{
    id: user.id,
    user_type: 'clinician',
    onboarding_completed: true
  }]);

// Did NOT create clinician_profiles record!
// Did NOT save name, title, specialty, etc.
```

### What Was Missing:
1. ❌ No call to `saveOnboarding()` hook
2. ❌ No creation of `clinician_profiles` record
3. ❌ No saving of first_name, last_name, title, specialty, etc.
4. ❌ All that data was just... lost!

---

## ✅ The Fix

### Changes Made:

1. **Added import:**
```typescript
import { useClinicianOnboarding } from "@/hooks/useClinicianOnboarding";
```

2. **Added hook:**
```typescript
const { saveOnboarding } = useClinicianOnboarding();
```

3. **Replaced broken code with proper hook call:**
```typescript
// Save ALL clinician data using the hook
const result = await saveOnboarding(user.id, {
  firstName: formData.firstName,
  lastName: formData.lastName,
  middleName: formData.middleName,
  title: formData.clinicianTitle,
  specialty: formData.specialty,
  institution: formData.institution,
  licenseNumber: formData.licenseNumber,
  patientEmails: formData.patientInviteEmails
});
```

## 📊 What Now Gets Saved

### 1. `private_health_info.clinician_onboarding_data`
- ✅ first_name
- ✅ last_name
- ✅ middle_name
- ✅ clinician_title
- ✅ specialty
- ✅ institution
- ✅ license_number
- ✅ patient_invite_emails
- ✅ completed_at

### 2. `public.clinician_profiles`
- ✅ user_id
- ✅ first_name
- ✅ last_name
- ✅ title
- ✅ specialty
- ✅ license_number
- ✅ institution

### 3. `public.patient_invitations`
- ✅ One record per email
- ✅ clinician_id
- ✅ patient_email
- ✅ patient_email_hash
- ✅ status: 'pending'
- ✅ expires_at

### 4. `public.profiles`
- ✅ user_type: 'clinician'
- ✅ onboarding_completed: true

---

## 🧪 Testing

### To Test the Fix:
1. Create a new clinician account
2. Complete onboarding with:
   - Title: "Prof."
   - First Name: "Test"
   - Last Name: "Clinician"
   - Specialty: "Neurology"
   - Institution: "Test Hospital"
   - License: "TEST123"
3. Check dashboard - should show "Prof. Clinician"
4. Check Supabase:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM public.clinician_profiles WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
   ```

### Expected Result:
- ✅ Dashboard shows correct name with title
- ✅ All fields populated in database
- ✅ No "Dr. User" fallback

## 🔍 Why This Happened

The component was written before the `useClinicianOnboarding` hook was created. When the hook was added, the component was never updated to use it.

This is a classic case of:
1. Hook exists ✅
2. Hook works correctly ✅
3. Component doesn't use the hook ❌

---

## ✅ Status: FIXED

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/onboarding/ClinicianOnboarding.tsx`

**What Works Now:**
- ✅ All clinician data saves to database
- ✅ `clinician_profiles` table gets populated
- ✅ Name displays correctly in dashboard
- ✅ Title (Dr., Prof., etc.) is saved and used
- ✅ Patient invitations are created
- ✅ Onboarding is marked complete

**Test with a new account to verify!** 🎉

Carefully assess all features systematically to ensure that they are all hooked up properly to the database, to other components and pages AND ensure we are always using the most beautiful, upto date version of any component - DELETE old ones after taking any necessary enhancements out for the other component - MAKE SURE we don't LOSE any amazing features. 

Tracking features, Onboarding Features and the Clinician Features are of utmost important. REMEMBER COMPLIANCE RULES. THINK ABOUT MY REQUEST BEFORE EVERY ACTION....

Go through and clean up all the documentation and files that are outdated or not used. Ensure we have HIPAA compliant documentation. 

Also do a bonus task for me and check on the types file - and make sure it matches the database (ESPECIALLY IF YOU MADE ANY DATABASE CHANGES IN THE LAST FEW HOURS!)

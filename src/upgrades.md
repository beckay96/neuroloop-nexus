Here is a **fully updated, detailed guide** for setting up a research-grade, patient-friendly brain region seizure tracking tool, now incorporating your new accessibility, UX, compliance, and precision feedback. Each recommendation below is vetted as either “important to include for this audience/use case” or deprioritized if unnecessary complexity for patients. The goal: keep it simple, safe, and educational, yet robust for research and clinical collaboration.

***

## 1. Patient-Facing UI Essentials

**Selection and Interaction**
- Rename main panel: “Select seizure signs (tick all that apply)” to encourage multiple selections.
- Empty state prompt: “Start by ticking symptoms on the left. Results update instantly.”
- Input grouping: Use clear headers for Auras, Motor Signs, Autonomic, etc., each with consistent inline examples (“Automatisms: lip smacking, chewing”).
- Search bar: Filters both labels and descriptions; “No results” hint offers example search terms.

**Accessibility and Clarity**
- All checkbox groups to use real <fieldset> and <legend>, with logical tab order for screen readers.
- Each region result card includes a collapsed “Details” section:  
  - Typical semiology (plain-language),  
  - “Signs often reported when this region is involved”,  
  - Common differentials (briefly),  
  - Red-flag symptom combos (non-diagnostic wording).
- All percentages shown with accessible contrast and patterned bar/Icon, never color alone.
- Rank badges to reflect actual sort order, with “ranked Xth by likelihood” as aria-label for access tools.
- Keyboard navigation, aria-live region for “results” so screen reader users hear updates.
- Likelihood legend: Move above the results, add tooltips (“Unlikely” etc.), and make pills clickable for sorting/filtering.

**Educational Boundaries**
- “Educational tool only” banner, fixed at top, always visible.
- Add result footer: “Educational use only. Seek medical care for seizures lasting >5 minutes or injury.”
- On each result: “Population estimates, not personal diagnosis. Accurate localization needs EEG/imaging.”
- Replace “Ready to explore your brain?” with “Explore likely brain regions (population estimates)”.

**Privacy and Data Safety**
- Data not stored by default; add a “Data not saved” line or “See privacy policy” link if logging to backend.
- If users opt into research, must see a consent modal with plain-language explanation.

***

## 2. Information Architecture & Methods

**Content Precision**
- Percentage results shown as “XX% (n=11,532; CI ±3%)” or via tooltip “Population estimate from published studies; not patient-specific.”
- “How this is calculated” link opens methodology drawer/popup (data sources, cohorts, last update).
- Region coverage caveat: “Tool trained on focal epilepsies; not validated for generalized epilepsies.”
- Last reviewed date and clinical reviewer badge if available.

**Safety & Next Steps**
- Add a “Next steps” panel under the result for patients:  
  - “If you experience recurrent seizures, EEG/MRI referral is typical.”  
  - “See seizure first-aid guide here (link).”

***

## 3. Engineering/Performance Fundamentals

- Debounce search/filter/checkbox updates (150–250ms) for snappy UX.
- Modal state: preserve selections within browser session.
- Likelihood pills clickable/sortable (show only ≥60%, for example).
- Mini map brain diagram beside results, colored by likelihood—no 3D required for MVP.
- “Clear selections” instead of “Reset”, with a toast confirmation.
- Telemetry: anonymized analytics of most-selected signs, time-to-first-result. Do not store any PHI unless explicitly consented.
- Export features: Copy link (query-string encoded for selected signs), PDF export, Print for clinical visits/research.

***

## 4. Research-Grade Data Architecture

**Backend Structure**
- All selection data stored as atomic values (enums, dates, ints, short text), never as JSON or blobs.
- Symptoms, triggers, post-ictal, and region highlight results all normalized in link tables.
- Main tables:
  - `SeizureLog`: event metadata.
  - `SymptomRegistry`: master enum table for UI symptoms.
  - `SeizureLogSymptoms`: one row per sign ticked for a log.
  - `BrainRegionRegistry`: master enum table for major regions.
  - `Symptom→RegionLink`: where each sign maps to a region and probability bin; laterality left as advanced unless patient specifically notes it.
  - `PostIctalRegistry`, `SeizureLogPostIctal`: for after-effects.

**Accessibility Reporting**
- Every fieldset, label, legend, aria-live, and button must be properly assigned.  
- Color-blind palettes with ≥4.5:1 contrast, never relying just on color.

***

## 5. Progressive Disclosure & Explanation

- Collapsible region panels: “Details” with:  
  - Typical features, 
  - Common similar conditions, 
  - “Why highlighted”: Example — “Visual aura is most often linked to occipital lobe involvement in research.”
- Every technical term is accompanied by a (i) info button, which opens a brief patient-friendly definition.

***

## 6. Compliance, Review & Content Governance

- Permanent methodology and data source link.
- Region coverage note (“focal epilepsy only” etc.).
- Last reviewed date, reviewer badge if available.
- Clinical safety disclaimers (top and bottom).
- Review privacy policy, never store PHI without opt-in.

***

## 7. Optional/Advanced Features (only if helpful, not confusing)

- Include a checkbox for “Symptoms mostly left/right/both sides of body?” if you want laterality for research—make it optional and fully explained.
- Export feature for research/clinicians ready now, patient view stays simple.

***

### **Quick Reference: What Gets Included for Patients**

- Every UI label and info panel is written for non-experts.
- Patient only sees: Simple checklists, instant results, clear color-and-pattern guides, and short next-step advice.
- Deeper research-content (sample size, CI, CV, methodology) is one click away, never front-and-center.
- No jargon, no diagnostic claims, just actionable education.

***

**Summary:**  
The platform remains friendly, fast, and actionable for patients at all times, but every value is research-grade and atomic under the hood. Accessibility, safety, and precision are front-of-mind. Every “extra” feature from your feedback is included only if it boosts comprehension/safety—otherwise, it’s kept to the backend or methodology drawer. This balances genuine patient empowerment with gold-standard research and regulatory compliance.Here’s a detailed guide for setting up your patient-facing, research-grade brain region seizure tracking tool, now rewritten based on your latest feedback and best practice recommendations:

***

## Patient-Facing UI & Experience

### 1. Selection and Guidance
- **Main heading:**  
  “Select seizure signs (tick all that apply)”
- **Intro prompt (empty state):**  
  “Start by ticking symptoms on the left. Results update instantly.”
- **Accessibility:**  
  - Fieldset/legend for checkbox groups, logical tab order, aria-live updates when results change.
  - Color-blind safe palette (≥4.5:1 contrast), patterned bars/icons for likelihood.
  - “Clear selections” with toast confirmation.

### 2. Symptom Taxonomy
- **Grouped checklists:**  
  - Auras (with examples)
  - Motor signs & movements (with examples)
  - Autonomic

***

### Summary

This guide balances low friction, patient-friendly symptom selection and results with robust, atomic, research-grade data behind the scenes. It’s compliant, accessible, and ready to support both clinical and future research goals—without overwhelming patients or introducing medical complexity. Laterality, if included, appears only when the patient understands it, otherwise it’s hidden and set to UNKNOWN for export. All features included are those with meaningful impact on safety, accuracy, and usability; anything less impactful is omitted to maintain clarity.

Here’s a comprehensive list of **seizure signs/semiology items** that should be in your patient-facing tool—each drawn from core ILAE classifications, the largest meta-analyses, and focal epilepsy research. For every sign, I include its typical description (patient-friendly label) and the references you should cite for thorough scientific validity.

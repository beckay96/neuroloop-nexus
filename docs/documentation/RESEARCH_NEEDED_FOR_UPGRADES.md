# üî¨ EXACT RESEARCH DATA NEEDED FOR BRAIN SEIZURE TOOL UPGRADES

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Today):
- ‚úì Bug fix (missing regions)
- ‚úì Added 10+ new seizure signs
- ‚úì Added confidence levels
- ‚úì ~40 total signs now (was ~30)

---

## üéØ NEXT UPGRADE: **LATERALIZATION** (Left vs Right Hemisphere)

### **Why Critical:**
- Surgical planning requires knowing **LEFT or RIGHT** hemisphere
- Doubles the clinical utility of the tool
- Research exists - just need to extract the data

---

## üìã STEP 1: GET THESE SPECIFIC PAPERS

### **MUST-HAVE Papers (in priority order):**

#### 1. **Mouthouri et al. (2021)** - "Lateralizing value of ictal semiology"
- **PubMed ID:** 33793889
- **Journal:** Epileptic Disorders
- **What to extract:** Table with lateralizing signs + confidence intervals
- **Key signs:** Dystonic posturing, Figure of 4 sign, Version

#### 2. **Barba et al. (2007)** - "Ictal clinical manifestations in temporal lobe epilepsy"  
- **PubMed ID:** 17662058
- **Journal:** Epilepsia
- **What to extract:** Ipsilateral vs contralateral probabilities for motor signs
- **Key data:** Automatisms lateralization, postictal nose wiping

#### 3. **Kotagal et al. (2003)** - "Complex partial seizures: lateralization and localization value"
- **Journal:** Seizure
- **What to extract:** Language signs lateralization (aphasia, preserved speech)
- **Key data:** Post-ictal aphasia = dominant hemisphere (usually left)

#### 4. **Dupont et al. (2010)** - "Lateralizing value of asymmetric tonic seizures"
- **Journal:** Neurology  
- **What to extract:** Contralateral vs ipsilateral motor sign probabilities
- **Key data:** Figure of 4 posturing, version, dystonia

---

## üìä STEP 2: EXTRACT THIS EXACT DATA FORMAT

For EACH lateralizing sign, I need:

```
Sign Name: "Dystonic Posturing"
Lateralization:
  - Contralateral to seizure focus: XX% [95% CI: XX-XX%]
  - Ipsilateral to seizure focus: XX% [95% CI: XX-XX%]
  - Bilateral: XX%
  - Odds Ratio: X.X [CI: X.X-X.X]
  - Confidence: High/Moderate/Low
```

### **Example of what I need:**

```
Post-Ictal Aphasia:
  - Dominant hemisphere: 89% [95% CI: 82-94%]
  - Non-dominant hemisphere: 11% [95% CI: 6-18%]
  - OR: 42.5 [18.2-99.3]
  - Confidence: Very High
  
Dystonic Posturing:
  - Contralateral hemisphere: 92% [95% CI: 84-97%]
  - Ipsilateral hemisphere: 8% [95% CI: 3-16%]
  - OR: 23.0 [8.7-60.8]
  - Confidence: Very High
```

## üìù STEP 3: SPECIFIC SIGNS TO PRIORITIZE

### **TIER 1 - Highest Clinical Value** (Get these first!)

1. **Dystonic Posturing** (Contralateral)
2. **Post-Ictal Aphasia** (Dominant hemisphere)  
3. **Ictal Speech Preserved** (Non-dominant hemisphere)
4. **Post-Ictal Nose Wiping** (Ipsilateral hand = ipsilateral focus)
5. **Figure of 4 Sign** (Contralateral)
6. **Head Version** (Contralateral - ONLY if sustained >10 sec)

### **TIER 2 - Good Supporting Data**

7. **Automatisms** (Ipsilateral hand slight preference)
8. **Eye Deviation** (Contralateral when sustained)
9. **Unilateral Tonic Activity** (Contralateral)
10. **Todd's Paralysis** (Ipsilateral to focus)

---

## üéØ HOW TO EXTRACT THE DATA

### **Option A: Manual Extraction (If you have access)**

1. Download the PDFs
2. Find the Results tables (usually Table 2 or 3)
3. Look for columns: "Ipsilateral %", "Contralateral %", "Odds Ratio", "95% CI"
4. Copy into Excel/Google Sheets
5. Send me the spreadsheet

### **Option B: I'll Help Parse** 

1. Get PDFs (via university access, Sci-Hub, etc.)
2. Share them with me
3. I'll create a structured extraction template
4. You verify the numbers match the paper

### **Option C: Use Existing Systematic Reviews**

- **Noachtar & R√©mi (2009)** has summary tables
- **PubMed ID:** 19490891
- This has pre-compiled lateralization data

---

## üèóÔ∏è HOW I'LL IMPLEMENT IT

Once you get me the data, I'll create:

```typescript
interface LateralizationData {
  signId: string;
  lateralization: {
    contralateral: number;  // % probability
    ipsilateral: number;
    bilateral: number;
    confidence_interval: string;  // e.g., "84-97%"
    odds_ratio: number;
  };
  clinicalNote: string;  // e.g., "Strong lateralizing value"
}
```

Then update the UI to show:
- "üî¥ Suggests LEFT hemisphere (contralateral to right-sided dystonia)"
- "üîµ Suggests RIGHT hemisphere (non-dominant speech preserved)"
- Visual hemisphere indicator on brain diagrams

---

## üìà EXPECTED IMPACT

**Before upgrade:**
- "Temporal Lobe: 83%"

**After upgrade:**
- "**LEFT** Temporal Lobe: 78% (Confidence: High)"
- "**RIGHT** Temporal Lobe: 22%"
- "Lateralization based on: Post-ictal aphasia (dominant hemisphere)"

---

## ‚è∞ TIMELINE ESTIMATE

**If you can get the 4 must-have papers:**
- Data extraction: ~2-4 hours (you doing it)
- Implementation: ~3-4 hours (me building it)
- Testing: ~1 hour
- **Total: 1-2 days to fully functional lateralization!**

---

## üöÄ PHASE 2 UPGRADES (After Lateralization)

Once lateralization is done, we can add:

### **Temporal Sequence** (Earlier signs = better localization)
- **Papers needed:** Jayalakshmi et al. (2019), Bonini et al. (2014)
- **Data needed:** "First sign" vs "Late sign" probabilities

### **Pediatric-Specific** (Different localizations in kids)
- **Papers needed:** Loddenkemper et al. (2011)
- **Data needed:** Age-stratified probabilities (0-2y, 2-12y, 12-18y, adult)

---

## üìû QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

Before getting the papers, tell me:

1. **Do you have university/hospital access** to journals? (PubMed, Elsevier, etc.)
2. **Or should I provide alternative sources?** (I can guide you to pre-prints/open access)
3. **How much time can you dedicate?** (2 hours? 1 day? 1 week?)
4. **Do you want me to create an extraction template first?** (So you know exactly what to look for)

---

## ‚úÖ BOTTOM LINE

**For LEFT/RIGHT lateralization, I need:**

**Minimum (Quick Win):**
- Mouthouri et al. (2021) - Just Table 2
- = 6 lateralizing signs with high accuracy

**Ideal (Comprehensive):**
- All 4 papers above
- = 15+ lateralizing signs with full confidence intervals

**I can work with whatever you get!** Even 1 paper is a massive upgrade.

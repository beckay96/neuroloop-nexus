2. **Complete patient dashboard** (stats, recent activity, achievements)
3. **Build clinician dashboard** (patient list, risk alerts, tools)
4. **Create carer dashboard** component
5. **Build researcher dashboard** with data access
6. **Add settings pages** (privacy controls, profile editor)
7. **E2E testing** with Playwright
8. **Production deployment**

## 💡 TIPS FOR TESTING

### Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Clear browser storage to test fresh signup
# In DevTools Console:
localStorage.clear()
sessionStorage.clear()
location.reload()

# Check Supabase Auth
# In DevTools Console:
const { data } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
console.log(data.user)

# Check profile
const { data: profile } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', data.user.id)
  .single()
console.log(profile)
```

### Database Queries

```sql
-- Check all test users
SELECT id, email, user_type, onboarding_completed, created_at
FROM public.profiles
WHERE email LIKE 'test-%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check onboarding status
SELECT p.email, p.user_type, op.completed, op.completed_at
FROM public.profiles p
JOIN public.onboarding_progress op ON p.id = op.user_id
WHERE p.email LIKE 'test-%';

-- Check points and achievements
SELECT p.email, up.total_points, up.current_level, COUNT(ua.id) as achievements
FROM public.profiles p
JOIN public.user_points up ON p.id = up.user_id
LEFT JOIN public.user_achievements ua ON p.id = ua.user_id
WHERE p.email LIKE 'test-%'
GROUP BY p.email, up.total_points, up.current_level;
```

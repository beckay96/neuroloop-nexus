# üöë **Emergency Popup & Daily Check-in - FIXED**

## ‚úÖ **What's Fixed:**

### **Emergency Popup Changes:**

1. **‚úÖ Position**: Moved to **bottom LEFT corner** (no longer right)
   - Clean, non-bouncing button
   - Removed `animate-pulse` - no more annoying animation

2. **‚úÖ Emergency Numbers**: Country-specific formatting
   - **Australia**: Shows "Call 000"
   - **USA/Canada**: Shows "Call 911"
   - **UK**: Shows "Call 999"
   - **Europe**: Shows "Call 112"
   - **New Zealand**: Shows "Call 111"
   - Currently defaults to Australia (000)
   - **TODO**: Pull from user profile `country_code` field

3. **‚úÖ Emergency Contact Button**: Simplified text
   - **Before**: "Call Rebecca-Kay Francis (Emergency Contact)"
   - **After**: "Call Rebecca-Kay" with "Emergency Contact" as subtitle
   - Less cluttered, easier to read in emergency

4. **‚úÖ Background**: Changed from brown to black
   - Black background instead of that gross brown/yellow
   - Red glowing border: `shadow-[0_0_15px_rgba(239,68,68,0.5)]`
   - Much more professional and attention-grabbing

5. **‚úÖ "Alert All Carers"**: Coming Soon badge added
   - Button is now disabled
   - Shows "Coming Soon" badge
   - Noted: Requires BAA with secure messaging service + payment gateway
   - This will be a premium feature when implemented

### **Daily Check-in Fix:**

6. **‚úÖ 400 Bad Request**: Fixed parameter passing
   - Changed from `|| null` to `?? undefined`
   - Allows RPC function to use DEFAULT values properly
   - Should resolve the save_symptom_log error

---

## üß™ **TEST NOW:**

### **1. Test Emergency Popup:**
1. Hard refresh: `Cmd + Shift + R`
2. Look for emergency button in **bottom LEFT corner**
3. Click it - should NOT be bouncing/pulsing
4. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ Shows "Call 000" (for Australia)
   - ‚úÖ Shows "Call [FirstName]" not full name
   - ‚úÖ Relationship shown as subtitle
   - ‚úÖ Black background with red glow
   - ‚úÖ "Alert All Carers" is disabled with "Coming Soon"

### **2. Test Daily Check-in:**
1. Click "Daily Check-in" button
2. Complete the 4-step tracking flow
3. **Expected**: No 400 error, saves successfully! ‚ú®
4. Check browser console - should be clean

---

## üîß **If Daily Check-in Still Fails:**

Check the browser console for the exact error. It might be:
1. **Type mismatch** - Check what the modal is sending vs what RPC expects
2. **Missing required fields** - `p_patient_id` and `p_log_date` are required

**Debug Query:**
```sql
-- Check what the function is receiving
SELECT 
    proname,
    pg_get_function_arguments(oid) as args
FROM pg_proc
WHERE proname = 'save_symptom_log';
```

---

## üìã **Next Steps:**

### **After Testing:**
1. If Daily Check-in works ‚úÖ ‚Üí Wire up mock data components
2. If still broken ‚ùå ‚Üí Share the exact console error

### **Future Enhancements:**
1. **Country Detection**: Get `country_code` from user profile
   - Add to `patient_phi` or `patient_onboarding_data`
   - Auto-detect from browser locale as fallback
   
2. **Premium Features**:
   - SMS/WhatsApp alerts to carers
   - Requires Twilio/MessageBird BAA
   - Payment gateway integration
   - Subscription management

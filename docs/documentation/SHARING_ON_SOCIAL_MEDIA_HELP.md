Ideal Format for Social Media (Instagram-Ready):
1. Generate a Custom Social Graphic Programmatically
Key elements:
1080x1080px (or 1080x1350px portrait) PNG for Instagram posts
Beautiful stylized, color-coded SVG or Canvas brain with:
Regions shaded by localization confidence
Laterality cues (e.g. glowing left/right hemispheres, labeled arrows)
Your app logo and name, plus a “Powered by NeuroLoop” or similar footer
Space for summary text (“Most likely: Left Frontal Lobe, 87% confidence”)
Option for fun or clinical icons (e.g. neuron, EEG wave, “Data from 4 signs” badge)
All main overlays/text should be real graphic/text elements—not rasterized from screenshots
2. How to Implement (Dev Guidance):
Render to SVG/Canvas in your frontend (using D3.js, React, or plain SVG).
Use html-to-image (e.g. html2canvas) or native SVG/Canvas export to generate a crisp image (not a browser screenshot, but true export).
Auto-brand your export: Add overlays as layers (logo, info block, icons), and consider a color border in your brand color.
Export filename should be catchy (“neuroloop-localization-2025-10-11.png”).
3. Extra Social Features:
Add a QR code overlay linking to a live results dashboard or patient story
Animate the export (turn it into a <5s “reveal” mp4 or GIF) for stories or TikTok
4. Bonus: Pre-made Templates
Offer “template themes:” clinical, bold, dark mode, etc., with toggles before export
Caption suggestions auto-included: “Precision brain localization powered by AI + clinical data”—ready to copy to post
5. Why This Beats a Screenshot:
Razor-sharp, scale-independent (looks perfect on all phones)
Custom, branded, always accurate. No accidental tabs/toolbars/artefacts
Sharable instantly anywhere: Instagram, Twitter/X, LinkedIn (and can be reimported if staging clinical reports)

Best Practices for Computer (Desktop/Laptop) Export and Social Sharing:
1. One-click Image Export (PNG or SVG)
User clicks “Export for Social” →
Your tool generates a perfectly branded, high-res PNG (or scalable SVG, for advanced users).
Optimal social media aspect ratios (square, portrait) selectable.
Include options for: app logo, custom badge, auto-caption, colored border.
2. Direct “Share” Integration
Share to… Buttons: Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram (via web workflow), TikTok (if using desktop web uploader), or email.
Implement using navigator.share API (for supported browsers) or fall back to “download then upload”.
Pre-fills image, caption, and suggested hashtags (“#NeuroLoop #EpilepsyAwareness #BrainTech”).
3. Clipboard Export
After image generation, offer “Copy to clipboard” so users can quickly paste into Instagram Stories, Tweets, or chat apps.
4. Generate and Share Unique Cloud Links
“Create Share Link” button:
Tool uploads export image and summary data to a private NeuroLoop server.
Returns a short, branded link (e.g. neuroloop.app/share/XYZZ12)
User can post/share the link, taking viewers to a polished web visualization or downloadable card.
5. Drag-and-Drop
Allow user to drag the export image directly from browser to desktop, social web uploaders, or chat apps.
6. QR Code for Cross-platform Sharing
Include a QR code in the export image.
Or as a pop-up, linking directly to the uploaded visualization or embed.
Great for conference, clinic, or direct-to-mobile bridging.
7. Call-to-Action/Badge
“Powered by NeuroLoop,” “Share your localization,” “Contribute to research”—adds virality and prompts sharing.
8. Brand Theme Customization
Users can choose their theme/style: modern, clinical, bold, dark mode, etc., before exporting.
Recap:
Enable seamless, branded image export (PNG/SVG).
Integrate direct share buttons for major social and clinical platforms.
Support clipboard, drag-and-drop, and cloud-link sharing.
Add branded touch and caption to every export.
When you implement, use open-source packages for sharing, export (html2canvas, dom-to-image, etc.), and image generation to avoid “screenshot” tackiness.

# Research-Validated Statistics: Parkinson's Disease & Epilepsy

## Hard-hitting statistics for death rates, prevalence, and global impact - VALIDATED with sources

Here are the latest, validated global statistics for Parkinson's disease and epilepsy—covering prevalence, death rates, and hard-hitting trends, with up-to-date sources:

***

### Parkinson’s Disease

- **People Living with PD:**
    - In 2021, an estimated **about 12 million people** worldwide were living with Parkinson's disease. This is projected to skyrocket to **25.2 million by 2050** (a 112% increase).[^1][^2]
    - As of 2019, the World Health Organization reported **8.5 million individuals** worldwide with Parkinson’s—**prevalence has doubled in the past 25 years**.[^3]
- **Prevalence Rate:**
    - By 2050, the all-age prevalence is forecast at **267 per 100,000 people**.[^2]
- **Death Rate \& Mortality:**
    - Between 1994 and 2019, over **1 million deaths globally** due to Parkinson's disease (more deaths in men than women), with the annual global mortality rate rising from **1.76 to 5.67 per 100,000**.[^4]
    - In the U.S. (1999–2022), there were **947,272 deaths** from Parkinson’s, with an age-adjusted mortality rate rising from **88.9 per million (1999) to 110.6 per million (2022)**.[^5]
    - From 1999 to 2020 (large global dataset): death rates increased from **5.3 to 9.8 per 100,000 population**.[^6]
- **Trend:**
    - Parkinson's is the world's **fastest-growing neurological disorder**, driven mainly by an aging population.[^7][^2]

### Epilepsy

- **People Living with Epilepsy:**
    - Recent estimates suggest **about 65 million people worldwide** are affected by epilepsy.
    - In 2021 alone, there were **3.27 million new cases** of epilepsy of unknown cause globally, with an incidence rate of **42.8 per 100,000 people**.[^8]
- **Death Rate \& Mortality:**
    - In 2021, there were **~140,000 deaths** worldwide from epilepsy of unknown cause (ASDR: **1.74 per 100,000**)—with mortality highest in those over 60 and children under 5.[^9][^8]
    - United States (2011–2021): **43,231 adult deaths linked to epilepsy**. The death rate with epilepsy as the underlying cause increased by **84% (2.9 to 6.4 per million)**; deaths with epilepsy as a contributing cause jumped **144% (3.3 to 11 per million)**.[^10]
    - Global mortality data show that older adults (>50, especially >75) are driving a rise in epilepsy-related deaths in high-income countries, even as general elderly mortality falls.[^11]

### Summary Table

| Condition | Living With (global) | Deaths/Year (global) | Death Rate | Trend/Note | Sources |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Parkinson's | 12M (2021); 25.2M (2050 est.) | ~1M from 1994–2019 | 1.76 → 5.67/100k (1994–2019) | Fastest-growing neuro disorder | [^1][^2][^4][^5][^7][^6] |
| Epilepsy | 65M (global) | ~140,000 (2021) | 1.74/100k (2021); up 84–144% in US (2011–2021) | Mortality rising esp. in elderly | [^8][^10][^11][^9][^12] |

These figures reflect real, validated, and recent global health burdens—clear evidence of the urgent need for improved care, research, and support.Here are hard-hitting, validated statistics for Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy, including death rates and number of people living with each condition, sourced from leading medical journals and health organizations.

### Parkinson’s Disease

- **Global Prevalence:** There are currently about **8.5 million people worldwide** living with Parkinson’s disease, and this is forecasted to rise dramatically to **25.2 million by 2050**—a 112% increase, largely due to population aging.[^1][^3][^2]
- **Death Rate:** Globally, deaths attributable to Parkinson’s have climbed steadily; in 2019, the mortality rate reached **5.67 per 100,000 population**, up from 1.76 per 100,000 in 1994. In the U.S. from 1999 to 2022 there were **947,272 deaths** due to Parkinson’s, with the age-adjusted mortality rate now at about **110.6 per million**.[^4][^5][^6]
- **U.S. Prevalence:** About **1.1 million Americans** live with Parkinson’s today.[^13]
- **Trend:** Parkinson’s is now the world’s **fastest-growing neurological disorder**.[^2]

### Epilepsy

- **Global Prevalence:** It’s estimated that **65 million people worldwide** are living with epilepsy at any time.[^8]
- **Death Rate:** In 2021, there were approximately **140,000 deaths globally due to epilepsy of unknown cause**, with an age-standardized death rate of **1.74 per 100,000**.[^9][^8]
- **U.S. Deaths:** From 2011–2021, there were **43,231 deaths** linked to epilepsy in U.S. adults. The U.S. mortality rate for epilepsy surged by **84%** (from 2.9 to 6.4 per million) for underlying cause, and by **144%** for contributing cause, across that decade.[^10]
- **Age Trend:** Mortality rates are particularly high in older adults and in young children; deaths among the elderly epilepsy population are consistently rising in high-income countries.[^11]

- **Trend:**
Parkinson’s is the fastest-growing neurological disease globally.[^2]

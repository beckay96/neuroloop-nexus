**Date:** January 6, 2025  
**Status:** 🟢 Deployed to Production  
**Commit:** 21c3824

## 🎉 What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Database Migration (COMPLETED)
**Executed in Supabase:** `DATABASE_SIGNUP_FIX.sql`

**Fixed Critical Errors:**
- ❌ `column "total_steps" of relation "onboarding_progress" does not exist` → ✅ FIXED
- ❌ `permission denied for table profiles (403)` → ✅ FIXED  
- ❌ `422 Unprocessable Entity on signup` → ✅ FIXED

**What Changed:**
- Dropped unused `onboarding_progress` table
- Fixed RLS policies on `profiles`, `patient_profiles`, `clinician_profiles`
- Created auto-profile trigger on signup
- Granted all necessary permissions

**Result:** Signup now works perfectly! 🎊

### 🧠 Brain Analysis Data Expansion

**Added 8 New Seizure Signs:**

**Post-Ictal Symptoms (5):**
1. Post-Ictal Confusion - confusion after seizure, memory fog
2. Post-Ictal Fatigue/Weakness - tired/weak after event
3. Post-Ictal Headache - headache after seizure
4. Post-Ictal Agitation - restless/irritable after
5. Post-Ictal Speech Difficulty - trouble speaking after

**Generalized/Bilateral Indicators (3):**
6. Bilateral Motor Activity - both sides affected equally
7. Tongue Biting/Incontinence - injury or urinary loss
8. Immediate Loss of Consciousness - no warning/aura

# Database Audit History Archive

This folder contains outdated database audit documentation from the initial menstrual tracking implementation (October 2025).

## What Happened

During the implementation of menstrual cycle tracking for catamenial epilepsy research, multiple audit and fix documents were created as issues were discovered and resolved.

## Final Resolution

All issues were consolidated into:
- **`FINAL_COMPREHENSIVE_DATABASE_FIXES.sql`** - The production SQL script (in root)
- **`COMPLETE_AUDIT_REPORT.md`** - The comprehensive audit report (in root)
- **`START_HERE.md`** - Quick start guide (in root)

## Files in This Archive

These files represent the iteration process but are no longer needed for reference:
- Multiple "RUN THIS" guides
- Intermediate audit reports
- Preliminary fix scripts
- Setup instructions (now consolidated)

## Reference

If you need to understand the audit process or see how issues were discovered:
1. Read `/COMPLETE_AUDIT_REPORT.md` (most comprehensive)
2. Review `/FINAL_COMPREHENSIVE_DATABASE_FIXES.sql` (the final solution)

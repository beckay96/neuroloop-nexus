## 🔐 SECURITY GUARANTEES

### Patient Privacy ✅
- Patients have full control via `data_sharing_preferences`
- Can set visibility per data type (seizures, tremors, gait, daily logs, media)
- Can control sharing per clinician, per carer
- Can opt-in/out of research per data type

### Clinician Access ✅
- Must have active connection (status = 'active')
- Must respect patient's sharing preferences
- Cannot see data if patient sets visibility to 'private'
- Access is audited automatically

### Carer Access ✅
- Must have active relationship
- Must have `can_view_health_data = true`
- Must respect patient's sharing preferences
- More restrictive than clinician access

### Research Access ✅
- Only approved researchers with advanced access
- Can ONLY read anonymized data
- Cannot access PHI directly
- Cannot link research_id back to user_id

### Admin Access ✅
- Can view for support purposes
- Cannot modify patient data without authorization

# ✅ RESEARCH ANONYMIZATION SYSTEM - COMPLETE!

**Date:** 2025-01-06 02:44 AM  
**Status:** 🎉 FIXED - PHI TRACKING IN CORRECT SCHEMA + AUTO-ANONYMIZATION  
**Compliance:** Gold Standard for Research Privacy

---

## 🔥 WHAT WAS WRONG (FIXED!)

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** All tracking tables were in PUBLIC schema ❌
- seizure_events in PUBLIC (WRONG - contains PHI)
- tremor_episodes in PUBLIC (WRONG - contains PHI)
- gait_episodes in PUBLIC (WRONG - contains PHI)
- daily_symptom_logs in PUBLIC (WRONG - contains PHI)
- clinical_media in PUBLIC (WRONG - patient videos/photos)

**THIS WAS A MASSIVE SECURITY ISSUE!** ❌

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS FIXED

### 1. Moved ALL Tracking Tables to `private_health_info` Schema ✅

**PHI tracking tables now in correct schema:**
- ✅ `private_health_info.seizure_events` (was public.seizure_events)
- ✅ `private_health_info.tremor_episodes` (was public.tremor_episodes)
- ✅ `private_health_info.gait_episodes` (was public.gait_episodes)
- ✅ `private_health_info.daily_symptom_logs` (was public.daily_symptom_logs)
- ✅ `private_health_info.clinical_media` (was public.clinical_media)

**Why this matters:**
- PHI is now properly isolated from general app data
- Access control is stricter
- Compliance with HIPAA requirements
- Easier to audit PHI access

### 2. Created `research` Schema ✅

**New schema for anonymized research data:**
- ✅ `research.seizure_events` - Anonymized seizure data
- ✅ `research.tremor_episodes` - Anonymized tremor data
- ✅ `research.gait_episodes` - Anonymized gait data
- ✅ `research.daily_symptom_logs` - Anonymized daily logs

**Key features:**
- Uses `research_id` ONLY (never real user_id)
- NO free text (no names, notes, descriptions)
- NO exact timestamps (date + hour only)
- NO location data
- NO media attachments
- Structured data only (JSONB for arrays)

### 3. Implemented Auto-Anonymization Triggers ✅

**Automatic data flow with consent checking:**

```
Patient logs seizure
    ↓
Data saved to private_health_info.seizure_events (FULL PHI)
    ↓
Trigger fires: check_research_consent()
    ↓
IF (visible_to_researchers = true AND research_seizure_data consent = true)
    ↓
Get research_id from linkage.research_id_map
    ↓
Copy ONLY approved fields to research.seizure_events
    ↓
ANONYMIZED data ready for research ✅
```

**What gets anonymized:**
- ✅ Exact timestamps → Date + hour only
- ✅ user_id → research_id (no way to link back)
- ✅ Free text notes → REMOVED (not copied)
- ✅ Names, witness info → REMOVED
- ✅ Exact locations → REMOVED
- ✅ Media URLs → REMOVED

**What gets preserved:**
- ✅ Clinical data (seizure type, severity, duration)
- ✅ Structured triggers (JSONB arrays)
- ✅ Structured symptoms (JSONB arrays)
- ✅ Medication context (boolean flags, hours since dose)
- ✅ Circadian patterns (hour of day)

---

## 🏗️ NEW ARCHITECTURE

### Schema Structure (5 Schemas Total)

```
1. linkage (DB ADMIN ONLY)
   └─ research_id_map (user_id ↔ research_id)
      • Access: DB admin + IRB-approved procedures ONLY
      • Never exposed to API/app code

2. private_health_info (PHI - STRICT ACCESS)
   ├─ patient_phi (identifiers, DOB, insurance)
   ├─ clinician_phi (NPI, DEA, licenses)
   ├─ seizure_events (FULL clinical data + PHI) ⭐ MOVED
   ├─ tremor_episodes (FULL clinical data + PHI) ⭐ MOVED
   ├─ gait_episodes (FULL clinical data + PHI) ⭐ MOVED
   ├─ daily_symptom_logs (FULL clinical data + PHI) ⭐ MOVED
   └─ clinical_media (videos, photos, docs) ⭐ MOVED

3. research (ANONYMIZED - RESTRICTED ACCESS)
   ├─ seizure_events (research_id, NO PHI) ⭐ NEW
   ├─ tremor_episodes (research_id, NO PHI) ⭐ NEW
   ├─ gait_episodes (research_id, NO PHI) ⭐ NEW
   └─ daily_symptom_logs (research_id, NO PHI) ⭐ NEW

4. clinical (PREMIUM FEATURES)
   └─ 10 tables for clinician dashboard features

5. public (GENERAL APP DATA)
   └─ 31 tables (profiles, onboarding, gamification, etc.)
```

## 🔐 SECURITY GUARANTEES

### PHI Protection ✅
- All patient tracking data in `private_health_info` schema
- Requires explicit access grants (not default)
- Row-level security enforced
- Audit trails on all access

### Research Privacy ✅
- Research schema has NO PHI
- Uses research_id that CANNOT be linked back (without DB admin access to linkage table)
- Only structured data, no free text
- Only accessible by approved research analysts
- Public/authenticated users have NO access

### Consent Control ✅
- Automatic consent checking before anonymization
- Patient must opt-in for EACH data type:
  - `research_seizure_data` (boolean)
  - `research_tremor_data` (boolean)
  - `research_gait_data` (boolean)
  - `research_symptom_data` (boolean)
- Also checks `default_share_with_researchers` (boolean)
- BOTH must be true for data to be anonymized

### Access Control ✅

**Who can access what:**

| Data Type | Patient | Clinicians | Carers | Researchers | Public |
|-----------|---------|------------|--------|-------------|--------|
| **private_health_info.seizure_events** | ✅ Own | ✅ Active patients only | ✅ If shared | ❌ Never | ❌ Never |
| **research.seizure_events** | ❌ Never | ❌ Never | ❌ Never | ✅ Approved only | ❌ Never |
| **linkage.research_id_map** | ❌ Never | ❌ Never | ❌ Never | ❌ Never | ❌ DB admin only |

## 🔄 AUTO-ANONYMIZATION FLOW

### Example: Patient Logs Seizure

```sql
-- 1. Patient logs seizure via app
INSERT INTO private_health_info.seizure_events (
    patient_id,  -- Real user ID
    occurred_at,  -- Exact timestamp
    seizure_type,
    severity,
    notes,  -- Free text with names, details
    location,  -- Home address
    witness_name,  -- "My wife Sarah"
    visible_to_researchers  -- Patient choice
) VALUES (...);

-- 2. Trigger fires: anonymize_seizure_to_research()
--    Checks:
--    a) visible_to_researchers = true?
--    b) data_sharing_preferences.default_share_with_researchers = true?
--    c) data_sharing_preferences.research_seizure_data = true?

-- 3. IF all true:
--    Get research_id from linkage.research_id_map
--    (Create new research_id if doesn't exist)

-- 4. Insert ANONYMIZED data to research schema
INSERT INTO research.seizure_events (
    research_id,  -- Anonymous ID (e.g., uuid-abc-123)
    occurred_at_date,  -- Date only: 2025-01-06
    occurred_at_hour,  -- Hour only: 14 (2 PM)
    seizure_type,  -- ✅ Preserved
    severity,  -- ✅ Preserved
    -- notes REMOVED ❌
    -- location REMOVED ❌
    -- witness_name REMOVED ❌
    ...
);

-- 5. Research dataset now contains:
--    - Clinical data for research
--    - NO way to identify patient
--    - NO PHI
--    - Ready for IRB-approved researchers
```

## 🎯 RESEARCH USE CASES

### What Researchers CAN Do ✅

**1. Seizure Frequency Analysis**
```sql
SELECT 
    research_id,
    COUNT(*) as seizure_count,
    AVG(duration_seconds) as avg_duration
FROM research.seizure_events
WHERE occurred_at_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
GROUP BY research_id;
```

**2. Trigger Pattern Analysis**
```sql
SELECT 
    jsonb_array_elements_text(possible_triggers) as trigger,
    COUNT(*) as frequency
FROM research.seizure_events
GROUP BY trigger
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
```

**3. Circadian Pattern Analysis**
```sql
SELECT 
    occurred_at_hour,
    COUNT(*) as seizure_count
FROM research.seizure_events
GROUP BY occurred_at_hour
ORDER BY occurred_at_hour;
```

**4. Cross-Condition Correlation**
```sql
SELECT 
    s.research_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT s.event_id) as seizure_count,
    AVG(d.mood) as avg_mood,
    AVG(d.sleep_quality) as avg_sleep
FROM research.seizure_events s
JOIN research.daily_symptom_logs d ON s.research_id = d.research_id
GROUP BY s.research_id;
```

### What Researchers CANNOT Do ❌

- ❌ Identify any specific patient
- ❌ Link research_id back to real identity (without DB admin + IRB approval)
- ❌ Access PHI data directly
- ❌ See patient names, addresses, phone numbers
- ❌ Access free text notes or descriptions
- ❌ View media attachments (videos, photos)
- ❌ Correlate with external datasets using identifiers

---

## 🔧 FUNCTIONS CREATED

### 1. `check_research_consent(patient_id, data_type)` ✅

**Purpose:** Check if patient has consented to research data sharing

**Returns:** BOOLEAN

**Logic:**
```sql
1. Query data_sharing_preferences
2. Check default_share_with_researchers
3. Check specific data type consent (research_seizure_data, etc.)
4. BOTH must be true
5. Return boolean
```

**Called by:** All anonymization triggers

### 2. `anonymize_seizure_to_research()` ✅

**Purpose:** Auto-copy seizure events to research schema with anonymization

**Trigger:** AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE on private_health_info.seizure_events

**Flow:**
1. Check visible_to_researchers flag
2. Call check_research_consent()
3. Get/create research_id from linkage table
4. Copy ONLY approved fields to research.seizure_events
5. Return (doesn't block original insert)

### 3. `anonymize_tremor_to_research()` ✅

**Same pattern for tremor episodes**

### 4. `anonymize_gait_to_research()` ✅

**Same pattern for gait episodes**

### 5. `anonymize_daily_log_to_research()` ✅

**Same pattern for daily symptom logs**

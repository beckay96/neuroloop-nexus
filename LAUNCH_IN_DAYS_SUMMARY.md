## ‚ö° CRITICAL: DO THESE TODAY

### 1. Upgrade to Teams Tier (15 min) üî¥ URGENT

**Why:** BAA requires Teams tier ($599/month). You cannot legally store real patient data without it.

**How:**
1. Go to https://app.supabase.com
2. Click your project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Billing**
4. Click **"Upgrade to Teams"**
5. Complete payment

**Cost:** $599/month (non-negotiable for HIPAA)

### 2. Request BAA (15 min) üî¥ URGENT

**Immediately after upgrading:**
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Legal** (or **Compliance**)
2. Click **"Request Business Associate Agreement"**
3. Fill out:
   - Company legal name
   - Address
   - Authorized signer name & email
   - Security officer contact
4. Submit

**Timeline:** Usually 1-3 business days for BAA signing. You said "days" so Supabase should fast-track.

**Until BAA signed:** Use ONLY fake/synthetic data. No real patient information.

### 3. Frontend Testing (1 hour)

Test these critical flows:

**Patient Onboarding:**
```bash
1. Sign up with test email
2. Complete all 5 onboarding steps
3. Add condition (e.g., Epilepsy)
4. Add medication (e.g., Keppra)
5. Set research consent
```

**Verify in database:**
```sql
-- Replace with your test user ID
SELECT 
    p.user_type,
    pp.first_name,
    p.onboarding_completed,
    COUNT(DISTINCT uc.id) as conditions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT um.id) as medications
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN patient_profiles pp ON pp.user_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN user_conditions uc ON uc.user_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN user_medications um ON um.user_id = p.id
WHERE p.id = 'YOUR_TEST_USER_ID'
GROUP BY p.user_type, pp.first_name, p.onboarding_completed;
```

**Tracking Features:**
```bash
1. Log a seizure (all 5 steps)
2. Log daily wellness
3. Log medication adherence
4. Verify data appears in database
```

**Audit Logging:**
```sql
-- Verify everything is logged
SELECT action, table_name, ip_address_hash, created_at
FROM audit_log
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_TEST_USER_ID'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Verify IPs are hashed (should be 64-char hex strings)
SELECT COUNT(*) as hashed_count
FROM audit_log
WHERE ip_address_hash ~ '^[a-f0-9]{64}$';
```

### 4. Security Verification (30 min)

Run final security checks:

```sql
-- 1. RLS enabled on all tables
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename NOT IN ('conditions', 'medications')
ORDER BY tablename;
-- ALL should show rowsecurity = true

-- 2. Audit triggers exist
SELECT DISTINCT trigger_name 
FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name LIKE 'audit_%';
-- Should show 7+ triggers

-- 3. Protected schema locked down
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'protected';
-- Should show "No direct access" policy

-- 4. No data leaks
SELECT 'profiles' as tbl, COUNT(*) as null_ids 
FROM profiles WHERE id IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 'patient_profiles', COUNT(*) 
FROM patient_profiles WHERE user_id IS NULL;
-- Should return 0 for both
```

---

## üìã BEFORE LAUNCH (Next 2-3 Days)

### Legal Documents (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Must publish before collecting real patient data:**

1. **Privacy Policy** (HIPAA required)
   - What PHI you collect
   - How you use it
   - User rights (access, delete, correct)
   - Breach notification
   - Contact info

2. **Terms of Service** (Standard legal protection)
   - Service description
   - User responsibilities
   - Liability limitations
   - Dispute resolution

3. **Notice of Privacy Practices** (HIPAA required)
   - How PHI may be used/disclosed
   - Patient rights
   - Complaint procedures

**Get legal help** - Don't DIY these. Use HIPAA-compliant templates or hire attorney.

**Cost:** $500-2,000 one-time for templates/review.

### Team Training (REQUIRED)

**All team members must complete HIPAA training:**
- What is PHI/ePHI
- Privacy Rule basics
- Security Rule basics
- Breach notification
- Incident reporting

**Resources:**
- Free HHS training: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/training/
- Paid courses: $50-200/person (certificate provided)

**Document completion dates** - Keep records for 6 years (HIPAA requirement).

### Operational Procedures (REQUIRED)

**Document these:**
1. **Incident Response Plan**
   - Who to notify
   - Containment steps
   - Investigation process
   - 60-day notification timeline (if 500+ affected)

2. **Backup & Recovery**
   - How to restore from PITR
   - Recovery time objective (RTO)
   - Testing schedule (quarterly)

3. **Data Retention**
   - 7-year audit log retention
   - User data deletion process
   - Backup retention policy

4. **Access Control**
   - Who has database access
   - Access review schedule (quarterly)
   - Carer/clinician access expiry (annual renewal)

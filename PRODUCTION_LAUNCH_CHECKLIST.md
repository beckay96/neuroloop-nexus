```bash
# Test with real email addresses (not real patient data yet)
1. Sign up as Patient
2. Complete onboarding (all 5 steps)
3. Verify profile created in database
4. Verify conditions/medications saved
5. Verify research consent recorded
```

**Verify in DB:**
```sql
SELECT 
    p.user_type,
    pp.first_name,
    p.onboarding_completed,
    COUNT(DISTINCT uc.id) as conditions_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT um.id) as medications_count,
    rc.consent_version
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN patient_profiles pp ON pp.user_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN user_conditions uc ON uc.user_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN user_medications um ON um.user_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN research_consent rc ON rc.user_id = p.id
WHERE p.id = 'TEST_USER_ID'
GROUP BY p.user_type, pp.first_name, p.onboarding_completed, rc.consent_version;
```

#### B. Tracking Features
```bash
1. Log a Seizure (all 5 steps)
2. Log Daily Wellness
3. Log Medication adherence
4. Log Symptom
5. Log Menstrual Cycle
```

**Verify in DB:**
```sql
-- Check all tracking data saved with proper enums
SELECT 
    'seizure_logs' as table_name, 
    COUNT(*) as count,
    MAX(created_at) as last_entry
FROM seizure_logs WHERE user_id = 'TEST_USER_ID'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'daily_wellness_logs', COUNT(*), MAX(created_at)

```

#### C. Audit Logging
```sql
-- Verify every action is logged
SELECT 
    action,
    table_name,
    ip_address_hash,
    created_at
FROM audit_log
WHERE user_id = 'TEST_USER_ID'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Verify IP addresses are hashed (not raw IPs)
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN ip_address_hash ~ '^[a-f0-9]{64}$' THEN 'HASHED ‚úÖ'
        ELSE 'NOT HASHED ‚ùå'

## ‚è≥ FINAL PRE-LAUNCH CHECKS (1 hour)

### Security Audit Queries

Run these final verification queries:

```sql
-- 1. Verify RLS is enabled everywhere
SELECT 
    tablename,
    CASE WHEN rowsecurity THEN '‚úÖ' ELSE '‚ùå FAIL' END as rls_status
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename NOT IN ('conditions', 'medications')  -- seed data tables
ORDER BY tablename;

-- 2. Verify audit triggers exist
SELECT 
    trigger_name,
    event_manipulation,
    event_object_table
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_name LIKE 'audit_%'
ORDER BY event_object_table;

-- 3. Verify IP hashing works
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_logs,
    COUNT(ip_address_hash) as logs_with_ip,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ip_address_hash ~ '^[a-f0-9]{64}$' THEN 1 END) as properly_hashed
FROM audit_log;

-- 4. Verify protected schema is locked down
SELECT 
    tablename,
    COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'protected'
GROUP BY tablename;

-- 5. Check for any NULL user_ids in user data (data leak check)
SELECT 
    'profiles' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as null_user_ids
FROM profiles
WHERE id IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 'patient_profiles', COUNT(*)
FROM patient_profiles
WHERE user_id IS NULL;
-- Should return 0 for all tables

-- 6. Verify research mapping is protected
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename = 'research_user_mapping';
-- Should show: protected | research_user_mapping

-- 7. Check breach detection is working
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_incidents,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN resolved_at IS NULL THEN 1 END) as unresolved
FROM security_incidents;

-- 8. Verify session settings (should error if not in team tier yet)
SHOW session_timeout;
-- Should show 30 minutes or similar
```

### Frontend Security Check

```bash
# 1. Check for console.log() calls (security leak)
grep -r "console.log" src/ | grep -v "node_modules" | wc -l
# Should be 0 or very few (remove sensitive data logs)

# 2. Check for hardcoded credentials
grep -ri "password" src/ | grep -v "node_modules" | grep -v "type.*password"
# Review each result - no hardcoded passwords

# 3. Check for exposed API keys
grep -r "SUPABASE" src/ | grep -v ".env" | grep -v "import"
# Should only show import statements

# 4. Build production version
npm run build
# Should complete without errors

# 5. Test production build locally
npm run preview
# Browse app, test all features
```

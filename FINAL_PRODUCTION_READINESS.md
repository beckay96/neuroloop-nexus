## üéØ FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**DO NOT LAUNCH YET**

The app has excellent foundations but lacks critical safety features for emergency use. With 6-8 hours of focused work, it can be production-ready.

**Priority Order:**
1. Run database scripts (30 min)
2. Integrate emergency button (1 hour)
3. Test emergency features (2 hours)
4. Initialize notifications (1 hour)
5. Complete testing (2 hours)
6. Deploy to staging (30 min)
7. Final verification (1 hour)

**Target Launch:** After completing above + 24 hour monitoring period
